## Five topics that I know very well
1. I know the different forms of inputs and outputs for JavaScript. You can take input from window alerts, text boxes, or straight from the terminal using readline. For outputs, ou can use window alerts, changing the innerHTML of an element, or console.log.

2. I know how to declare variables and the different data types they use. Each variable can be a string, number, boolean or can be unknown or null.

3. I know how to use the different operators in JavaScript. Arithmetic operators output the results for operations. Comparison operators output a boolean telling whether the comparison is true or false. Logical operators output boolean values for relating two other different boolean values. Lastly, assignment operators can assign a new value to a variable.

4. I know how to use the conditional control structure in JavaScript. The basic form is the if-statement which executes a something if a condition is true. You can add onto this with an else-statement. This makes it so that if something is false another statement is executed. You can create chains of if-else statements to create specific actions for specific cases. Another thing you can use aside from the if-else statements are also the switch and case statements.

5. I know how to use loop control strucures in JavaScrit. The basic form is the while loop which repeats a statement as long as a condition is true. This can be tweaked into the do-while loop which executes the statement before checking the condition, making sure that the statement is ran at least once. If the number of iterations to execute is known, then a short-cut for the while loop can be used in the form of a for loop which declares an index variable and increments it until it meets a certain condition where the loop stops.
