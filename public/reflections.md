# Reflections

## Five topics that I know very well

### 1. Inputs and Outputs
You can take **input** from *window alerts*, *text boxes*, or straight from the *terminal* using readline. For **outputs**, you can use window *alerts*, changing the *innerHTML* of an element, or *console.log*. Aside from the lectures and the given material in Khub, I really got a lot of practice on this from my own experimentation and the different graded exercises.

### 2. Variable Declaration
Each variable can be a **string**, **number**, **boolean** or can be **unknown** or **null**. Most of this was already taught in the previous school year with maybe a few changes like a shortcut of using *number* rather than having to specify that it's an *integer* or it's a *float*.

### 3. Operators
**Arithmetic operators** output the results for operations. **Comparison operators** output a boolean telling whether the comparison is true or false. **Logical operators** output boolean values for relating two other different boolean values. Lastly, **assignment operators** can assign a new value to a variables. All these have also been taught in the previous school year but maybe some of the harder parts to understand are the short cuts in the syntax that JavaScript allows for. Like how when adding a *string* and a *number* would concatenate the *number* and the *string* but then when you multiply them the *string* is turned into a *number* and you get the product. Another weird part of the syntax is how you can take the *boolean* value of a *non-boolean* variable. You can get a *true* if the variable contains something and a *false* if the variable doesn't contain anything. These weird short cuts done in JavaScript is really foreign and can only really be mastered through continuous experience and practice.

### 4. Conditional Control Structure
The basic form of **conditional control strucutres** is the *if-statement* which executes a something if a condition is true. You can add onto this with an *else-statement*. This makes it so that if something is false another statement is executed. You can create chains of *if-else statements* to create specific actions for specific cases. Another thing you can use aside from the *if-else statements* are also the *switch* and *case* statements. Most of these forms of conditional statements are similar to C++ so they were easy to understand.

### 5. Loop Control Structure
The basic form of **loop control structures** is the *while* loop which repeats a statement as long as a condition is true. This can be tweaked into the *do-while* loop which executes the statement before checking the condition, making sure that the statement is ran at least once. If the number of iterations to execute is known, then a short-cut for the while loop can be used in the form of a *for* loop which declares an index variable and increments it until it meets a certain condition where the loop stops. Similar to the **conditional control structures**, all of these forms are also in C++ which made it easy to learn and understand.

## Five topics that I need further practice on

### 1. CSS
I have already done a lot of experimentation on **HTML** and **JavaScript** but I have barely done any experimentation on **CSS**. There are a lot of styles and different possibilities for customization that I could use in **CSS**. There are also animations which can really bring life to a website. Overall, there are just a lot of things in **CSS** that I haven't touched on and I wish I could practice it more.

### 2. Arrays
There are some components of **arrays** that I haven't fully explored or used to the fullest. The whole thing is already intuitive. It was taught to us last school year. There are just some more interesting things that I wanna experiment with like key and value pairs. All of these stuff are essential for getting into more complex topics like using JSONs or maybe even object oriented programming.

### 3. Functions
Similar to **arrays**, there are a lot of concepts involving **functions** that I haven't fully explored. Something that I really wanna explore is the *this* keyword. I wanna be able to understand it more and use it. Understanding and using it can probably bring me to more complex topics like the previously mentioned object oriented programming.

### 4. Short-cuts
I wanna be able to understand my own **style** of coding in order to know when to apply different **short-cuts**. Things like *arrow functions* or the previously mentioned **short-cuts** with the *different operators* are something that I wanna integrate into my code. However, I want this integration into my code to be natural. I want it to arise from the natural need for **short-cuts** rather than actually forcing myself to shorten my code. Instead of learning the syntax, I instead learn through continuous practice and training.

### 5. JavaScript Libraries
Progressing from **basic syntax** and more complex concepts like **object oriented programming**, the next step would be to learn **libraries**. This is still a far off topic but I am already interested in it. If I really wanna jump into building a website already, learning about **libraries** like *React* can be really useful.

## Plan of action to understand further the topics listed
When it comes to programming, I believe that experience is the best teacher. Instead of boring yourself with reading up on syntax or theory, genuinely apply it into building something that you want. Even if it's simple like the note-taking website, just build something and have fun in the process. Building and applying all of the syntax will give you the essential experience you need to progress through the different complex topics that you want to tackle.

## Activities Done in Class

### Effetive

- **Graded Exercises** - The graded exercises were really helpful in helping me apply and use the different syntax and concepts being taught in class. They were also really fun. It really helped me learn and get used to the different nuances of JavaScript.
- **Websites by Sir Roy** - These websites give simple explanations and great examples for the use of the different concepts and syntax being taught. I also like the way that these websites invite you to actually think of the concept being taught. They also provide fun and interesting exercises.

### Not Effective

- **Objective Questions on Syntax** - Since I heavily believe that experience is the best teacher for programming, objective questions are something that I don't really enjoy. I think objective tests should focus more on the ability to follow the code and understand what each statement does in order to form an output. Only a few items should be dedicated to basic syntax. Objective questions that are purely on syntax should be kept minimal and for review only.
- **Khub Resources** - The resources in Khub provide a lot of information but a large part of it is text. It's different from the websites of Sir Roy which use a lot of different examples to explain concepts but rather just tell the concepts in long paragraphs. There are some concepts that require long paragraphs to explain but it can be a little bit more interesting to show more examples or provide fun exercises.
